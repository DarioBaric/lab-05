        <h3>Welcome to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.</h3>

        <p> I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. 
            But during the last year, I started selling some of my favoriteHalloween products, and they've become quite a hit.
            If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films.
            And if you join my email list, I willkeep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
